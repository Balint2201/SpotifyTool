# SpotifyTool
Installs [SpotX](https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX) and [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) at the same time.
Because the 2.0.0 version, now you can update and remove [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/).
Recommended to keep the SpotifyTool after installing because to update [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) like this, is way more easier then the regular, but your computer and Spotify won't get any damage if you remove the SpotifyTool.

# Install
Go to the [relases](https://github.com/Balint2201/SpotifyTool/releases/) page and download the newest file.

# Important notice!
If you have [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) already installed the tool's install feature won't work!
